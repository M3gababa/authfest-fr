# Auth Rocks UI

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how simple it is to set up and use the new Single Page Application SDK, and authenticate a user in your application using Auth0's Universal Login Page.

### Specifying Auth0 Credentials

To specify the application client ID and domain, make a copy of `auth_config.json.example` and rename it to `auth_config.json`. Then open it in a text editor and supply the values for your application:

```json
{
  "domain": "{DOMAIN}",
  "clientId": "{CLIENT_ID}"
}
```
